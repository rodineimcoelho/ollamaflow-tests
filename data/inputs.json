Please fix the stability issues.",
  "The app has great potential with its easy-to-use interface and wide range of features. However, I've noticed that it drains my battery very quickly.

Also, the app sometimes fails to save my work automatically, which has caused me to lose progress on multiple occasions.",
  "This app is a powerful tool for creating stunning visuals, but it has some major connectivity issues.

The developers need to ensure that updates are seamless and do not interfere with the app's functionality.",
  "This app is excellent for quick design work, but I've had issues with its compatibility on different devices. It works fine on my tablet, but when I switch to my phone, some features are missing or don't work properly. Consistency across devices would make this app much more reliable and user-friendly. Also, the in-app purchases are quite expensive and not always worth the price.",
  "I love the design capabilities of this app, but it takes too long to load, especially when opening large projects. This makes it difficult to use for professional work where time is of the essence. Additionally, the app sometimes crashes when trying to apply certain effects, which can be really annoying. Please work on optimizing the performance and stability of the app.",

I get spammed with useless notifications about shows I don't care about. Fix your damn app!",

  "The app often requires restarting to fix minor bugs. It would be much better if the app could handle these issues without needing a full restart.",
  "There’s a noticeable delay between what I say and when others hear it. This lag makes conversations awkward and interrupts the flow of discussion.",
  "The app doesn't offer an easy way to mute all participants at once. This feature would be particularly useful for large meetings or webinars.",
  "The app’s performance deteriorates significantly when the video is set to high resolution. Lowering the resolution helps, but it’s not ideal for high-quality meetings.",
  "The app's text chat feature is limited. It lacks formatting options and doesn't support file attachments, which would be useful for sharing documents during calls.",
  "There’s no way to see who has joined or left the call. Implementing a participant list that updates in real-time would be very helpful.",

  "Uber Eats used to be my go-to for food delivery, but lately the app has been super unreliable. The tracking feature is totally messed up – it either shows the driver stuck at the restaurant for ages or doesn't update at all.

The delivery was late too, and the food was cold by the time it arrived. Really disappointing service.",
